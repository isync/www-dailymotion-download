WWW::Dailymotion::Download
==========================

Similar to [xaicron](https://github.com/xaicron/)'s effort [WWW::YouTube::Download](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::YouTube::Download) (also on [github](https://github.com/xaicron/p5-www-youtube-download)),
this script is a Perl replacement for what the python
based youtube-dl does: 
help a user download videos from Dailymotion.com.

## Origin

Found some time to worik on it. Got it back into a barely usable state again.

Anyone willing to help out? Happy fork'ing!

## Origin

I've found the scipt [dailymotion-dl.pl](http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/G/GN/GNUTOO/dailymotion-dl.pl)
abandoned on the CPAN. No user email was to be found, no description,
and it had been deleted from CPAN. The Backpan had a
copy, with the original GNU open source license intact.
